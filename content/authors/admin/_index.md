Hey there! :wave:

I‚Äôm **Ritabrata Chakraborty**, a final-year student at **BITS Pilani**, pursuing Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Data Science.  

My journey began with game development in high school and has since grown into a deep focus on **machine learning, robotics, and computer vision**. Today, I work at **Uber** as a **Computer Vision Research Intern**, where I‚Äôm developing **foundation model‚Äìdriven annotation pipelines** that support autonomous vehicle perception systems.

Beyond my current role, I‚Äôve worked on projects involving **UAV navigation, multi-robot coordination, synthetic data generation, and uncertainty-guided path planning**. I aim to bring **cutting-edge ML research into practical robotics applications** ‚Äî bridging the gap between academic innovation and real-world deployment.

## Future Project Initiatives

- **üèë Automated Hockey Ball Launcher** - Planned hardware-software system for controlled shot generation and data collection. Progress limited by hardware and funding. Seeking collaborators to advance this project.  
{{< icon name="external-link-alt" pack="fas" >}} [Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/HRz1ukUfeNL3hqlYc-ujwStbHiagaJXslbwzokdMNBc/edit?tab=t.0)

<!-- this blank line creates a visible gap -->

- **üåë 3D Lunar/Mars Terrain Modelling for Rover Simulation** - Proposed DEM-based 3D planetary terrain environment for rover navigation research. Delayed by resource constraints. Open to collaboration from planetary robotics experts.
