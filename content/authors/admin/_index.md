Hey there! :wave:

I’m **Ritabrata Chakraborty**, a final-year student at **BITS Pilani**, majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Data Science. My tech journey started in high school with game development, and that spark has evolved into a full-blown passion for **AI, machine learning, and robotics**.

Currently, I’m working at **Uber** as an ML Research Engineer, building **foundation models** that power autonomous vehicle annotation systems. Along the way, I’ve explored **computer vision, UAV navigation, multi-robot coordination, synthetic data generation, and uncertainty-guided path planning** — always striving to bridge cutting-edge research with real-world impact.

Beyond tech, I’m a **chess enthusiast**, constantly chasing strategy whether it’s on the board or in tackling research challenges. I’m eager to learn, grow, and collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what **AI and robotics** can achieve.

## Current Research & Work

- **CV Research Intern at Uber**: Enhancing annotation quality in uLabel by integrating foundation models for RGB/IR image auto-labelling, significantly reducing manual annotation time
- **Vision-Language Grounded Multi-Robot Coordination**: Adapting VLMaps for multi-agent collaboration with decentralized navigation
- **Uncertainty-Guided Path Planning**: Co-developing CogniPlan with Wasserstein GAN-based conditional inpainting for navigation

## Technical Expertise

- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, Weights & Biases
- **Robotics & Simulation**: ROS, Gazebo, MoveIt, AirSim, MAVROS, Navigation Stack
- **Computer Vision**: YOLO models, object detection, visual servoing, SLAM
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA Jetson (Nano, Orin), Raspberry Pi, Arduino, 3D LiDAR, Stereo Cameras
- **Programming**: Python, C++, C, Shell (Linux)

## Recent Achievements

- **3rd Place**: MathWorks Global Drone Student Challenge 2025
- **Conference Paper**: "CogniPlan: Uncertainty-Guided Path Planning with Conditional Generative Layout Prediction" accepted at CoRL 2025
- **PHM 2025**: "An Efficient Approach for Synthetic Data Generation and Fault Diagnosis for Rotating Machinery" (Published in IET Conference Proceedings)
- **PPSTA 2024**: Poster on "High-Velocity Impact Testing and Analysis of Layered Metal-Composite Shields Using Electromagnetic Railguns"
- **Leadership**: President of Mechanical Engineering Association and ISHRAE BITS Pilani chapter

I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of autonomous systems and applying cutting-edge ML techniques to real-world robotics challenges.
