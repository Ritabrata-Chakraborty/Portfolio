Welcome to my space! :wave:

I am Ritabrata Chakraborty, an ML Research Engineer currently working at **Uber** on foundation models for autonomous vehicle annotation systems. I'm pursuing a B.E. in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Data Science at **BITS Pilani**.

My research focuses on **computer vision**, **robotics**, and **autonomous systems**. I have experience in multi-robot coordination, UAV navigation, synthetic data generation, and uncertainty-guided path planning. My work spans from theoretical research to practical implementations in real-world robotic systems.

## Current Research & Work

- **ML Research Intern at Uber**: Enhancing annotation quality in uLabel by integrating foundation models for RGB/IR image auto-labelling, significantly reducing manual annotation time
- **Vision-Language Grounded Multi-Robot Coordination**: Adapting VLMaps for multi-agent collaboration with decentralized navigation
- **Uncertainty-Guided Path Planning**: Co-developing CogniPlan with Wasserstein GAN-based conditional inpainting for navigation

## Technical Expertise

- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, Weights & Biases
- **Robotics & Simulation**: ROS, Gazebo, MoveIt, AirSim, MAVROS, Navigation Stack
- **Computer Vision**: YOLO models, object detection, visual servoing, SLAM
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA Jetson (Nano, Orin), Raspberry Pi, Arduino, 3D LiDAR, Stereo Cameras
- **Programming**: Python, C++, C, Shell (Linux)

## Recent Achievements

- **3rd Place**: MathWorks Global Drone Student Challenge 2025
- **Conference Paper**: "CogniPlan: Uncertainty-Guided Path Planning" accepted at CoRL 2025
- **Research Publications**: Multiple papers in robotics, UAV navigation, and fault diagnosis
- **Leadership**: President of Mechanical Engineering Association and ISHRAE BITS Pilani chapter

I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of autonomous systems and applying cutting-edge ML techniques to real-world robotics challenges.
