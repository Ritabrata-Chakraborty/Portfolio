I'm **Ritabrata Chakraborty**, a final-year student at **BITS Pilani** pursuing Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Data Science.

My journey began with game development in high school and has since evolved into a deep focus on machine learning, robotics, and computer vision. Currently, I work at Uber as a Machine Learning Intern, developing foundation model-driven annotation pipelines that support autonomous vehicle perception systems.

Beyond my current role, I've worked on projects involving UAV navigation, multi-robot coordination, synthetic data generation, and uncertainty-guided path planning. My goal is to bring cutting-edge ML research into practical robotics applications, bridging the gap between academic innovation and real-world deployment.

## Open Collaboration & Opportunities

I'm currently seeking funding and collaborators for two ongoing initiatives:

- **🏑 Automated Hockey Ball Launcher** - Planned hardware-software system for controlled shot generation and data collection. Progress limited by hardware and funding. Seeking collaborators to advance this project.  
{{< icon name="external-link-alt" pack="fas" >}} [Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h7X9fIiih37ivgERVR-wbWsDEil0qvpI/view?usp=drive_link)

- **🌑 3D Lunar/Mars Terrain Modelling for Rover Simulation** - Proposed DEM-based 3D planetary terrain environment for rover navigation research. Open to collaboration from planetary robotics experts.  
{{< icon name="external-link-alt" pack="fas" >}} [Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRz1ukUfeNL3hqlYc-ujwStbHiagaJXslbwzokdMNBc/edit?tab=t.0)

Beyond these specific projects, I'm open to internships, research partnerships, and other professional opportunities in robotics, computer vision, and autonomous systems. Whether you're interested in collaboration, have project ideas, or want to discuss potential roles, I'd be glad to connect.
