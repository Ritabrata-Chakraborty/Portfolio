Hey there! :wave:

I‚Äôm **Ritabrata Chakraborty**, a final-year student at **BITS Pilani**, pursuing Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Data Science.  

My journey began with game development in high school and has since grown into a deep focus on **machine learning, robotics, and computer vision**. Today, I work at **Uber** as a **Computer Vision Research Intern**, where I‚Äôm developing **foundation model‚Äìdriven annotation pipelines** that support autonomous vehicle perception systems.

Beyond my current role, I‚Äôve worked on projects involving **UAV navigation, multi-robot coordination, synthetic data generation, and uncertainty-guided path planning**. I aim to bring **cutting-edge ML research into practical robotics applications** ‚Äî bridging the gap between academic innovation and real-world deployment.
