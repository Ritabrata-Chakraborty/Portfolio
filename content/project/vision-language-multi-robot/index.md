**Work in Progress**

This project develops a multi-robot coordination system that integrates vision and natural language processing for collaborative navigation in dynamic environments.

## Overview

The system enables multiple robots to understand visual scenes, interpret natural language commands, and coordinate their navigation in dynamic environments. Key focus areas include real-time adaptation to changing conditions and collaborative task execution.

## Key Capabilities

- **Vision-Language Integration**: Multimodal understanding for scene interpretation
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Real-time path planning in changing environments
- **Multi-Robot Coordination**: Distributed algorithms for team collaboration
- **Natural Language Interface**: Intuitive command interpretation
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Response to dynamic environmental conditions

## Technical Approach

### Core Components
- **Vision-Language Models**: Multimodal understanding for scene interpretation
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Collision-free path planning with real-time adaptation
- **Coordination Algorithms**: Distributed decision-making for multi-robot teams
- **Communication Framework**: Real-time inter-robot coordination

### Focus Areas
- Navigation in dynamic environments with moving obstacles
- Real-time adaptation to changing conditions
- Scalable coordination for varying team sizes
- Integration of visual and linguistic information for decision-making

## Applications

- Warehouse automation and logistics
- Search and rescue operations  
- Service robotics in dynamic environments
- Smart manufacturing and assembly
