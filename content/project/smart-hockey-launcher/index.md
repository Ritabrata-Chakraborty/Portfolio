This project focuses on developing an automated field hockey ball launcher with precision pneumatic control, variable trajectory programming, and integrated safety systems for training applications in sports facilities.

**This work is currently in development and seeking collaboration opportunities for prototype validation.**

## Project Overview

This research addresses the lack of automated training equipment in field hockey by developing a pneumatic-driven ball launcher system capable of delivering consistent ball trajectories with programmable speed, angle, and timing control for skill development applications.

## Key Components

• **Pneumatic Launch System**: Compressed air-driven mechanism with pressure regulation valve system enabling ball speeds from 20-80 km/h with ±3% repeatability across multiple launches.

• **3-Axis Positioning Platform**: Motorized servo system providing azimuth rotation (±90°), elevation control (-5° to +45°), and ball feed positioning with 0.5° accuracy for precise trajectory placement.

• **Microcontroller Integration**: Arduino Mega-based control system with sensor feedback loops, safety interlocks, and wireless communication modules for remote operation and parameter adjustment.

## Technical Innovation

The system addresses training limitations in field hockey where manual ball feeding lacks consistency and precision. The pneumatic approach ensures silent operation compared to mechanical alternatives while providing rapid-fire capability (3-5 balls/minute) essential for drill sequences.

## Current Development Status

- Completed mechanical design and CAD modeling with stress analysis validation
- Implemented pneumatic system with pressure regulation and ball feed mechanism  
- Developed control software with trajectory calculation algorithms
- Integrated safety systems including emergency stops and pressure monitoring

## Expected Contributions

- First automated pneumatic ball launcher specifically designed for field hockey training
- Novel ball feed mechanism optimized for hockey ball geometry and weight
- Integrated safety system meeting sports equipment standards
- Cost-effective solution for training facilities and coaching programs

## Collaboration Opportunities

I am actively seeking collaboration with:
- Sports equipment manufacturers for commercialization potential
- Field hockey coaching professionals for validation testing
- Mechanical engineering teams for advanced automation features
- Sports facilities for real-world deployment and feedback
