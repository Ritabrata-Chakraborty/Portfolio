**Competition Result: 5th Place + Best Maintenance Award (2023)**

## Overview

Developed a comprehensive autonomous rover navigation and robotic manipulation system for the European Rover Challenge, combining computer vision, autonomous navigation, and precision robotic arm control for space exploration applications.

• Navigated ExoMy rover using ArUco detection, Ackermann steering, and spot turns for autonomous hazard avoidance

• Calibrated UR3 arm with MoveIt and OMPL planner for collision-free manipulation (98% success)

## Technical Stack

**Tech Stack**: ROS Noetic & ROS 2 Foxy (with Gazebo, Rviz), MoveIt, OpenCV
