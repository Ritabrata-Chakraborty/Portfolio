This project proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based reactive planner to solve large-scale Lidar-based autonomous robot exploration problems in 2D action space. The DRL-based planner enables agents to reactively plan exploration paths by making implicit predictions about unknown areas, based on learned estimations of the underlying transition model of the environment.

## Overview

This work presents a deep reinforcement learning-based reactive planner for large-scale autonomous robot exploration using Lidar sensors. The approach relies on learned attention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies at different spatial scales, enabling robots to reason about their entire belief over known areas and make intelligent exploration decisions.

The system utilizes ground truth information (privileged learning) to guide environment estimation during training, combined with a graph rarefaction algorithm that allows models trained in small-scale environments to successfully scale to large-scale scenarios.

## Key Innovation: Alpha Conditioning System

The enhanced system introduces **alpha conditioning (α ∈ [0,1])** for dynamic exploration-exploitation control:
- **α = 0.0**: Pure exploitation (efficient, direct paths)
- **α = 0.5**: Balanced exploration-exploitation  
- **α = 1.0**: Pure exploration (frontier-seeking behavior)

## Core Technical Components

### 1. Attention-Based Architecture
- **Graph Attention Networks**: Process variable-size spatial graphs (1-360 nodes)
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Captures long-term dependencies across different spatial scales
- **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: 6-layer transformer encoder + 1-layer decoder
- **Dynamic Graph Processing**: QuadTree-based spatial indexing for efficient node management

### 2. Alpha Conditioning Integration
The α parameter provides continuous behavioral control through:
- **Policy Network**: Alpha embedding added to current state features
- **Critic Network**: Alpha concatenated to action features  
- **Adaptive Entropy**: Entropy targets vary with α values
- **Reward Shaping**: `r(α) = a·r_coverage + α·r_exploration`

### 3. Privileged Learning Framework
