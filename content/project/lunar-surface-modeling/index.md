This work focuses on developing a high-fidelity 3D lunar surface modeling system using Chandrayaan-2 TMC DEM data, addressing critical limitations in existing ROS simulators for planetary rover mission planning and autonomous navigation research.

**Competition: AI for Space and Geospatial Innovation (ISRO Immersion Startup-Challenge)**  
**Result: Finalist (2024)**

**This work is currently in development and I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities.**

## Project Overview

This research introduces a novel planetary simulation framework that leverages Unreal Engine 5's Nanite technology to create photorealistic lunar environments from authentic ISRO satellite datasets, enabling comprehensive testing of rover navigation algorithms before deployment.

## Key Components

• **Chandrayaan-2 TMC DEM Integration**: Direct import and processing of high-resolution Digital Elevation Model data from India's lunar mission, providing authentic terrain geometry for simulation environments.

• **Nanite-Powered Terrain Rendering**: Revolutionary virtualized geometry system enabling efficient large-world rendering and seamless loading of massive planetary surface datasets without traditional polygon limitations.

• **Advanced Material Systems**: Sophisticated surface property simulation incorporating lunar regolith characteristics, lighting conditions, and photometric properties for realistic computer vision algorithm testing.

## Technical Innovation

The project addresses fundamental scalability issues in current open-source simulators (AirSim, CARLA) that lack optimization for planetary-scale datasets and utilize outdated UE4 engines. By leveraging UE5's cutting-edge rendering pipeline, the system achieves unprecedented fidelity while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Current Development Status

- Successfully implemented Chandrayaan-2 DEM data import pipeline
- Developed high-fidelity surface reconstruction algorithms
- Optimized rendering system for large-scale planetary environments
- Established foundation for future ROS integration and SLAM capabilities

## Expected Contributions

- First comprehensive UE5-based lunar simulation environment using authentic ISRO data
- Novel DEM-to-mesh conversion algorithms optimized for planetary terrain
- Scalable framework for multi-mission planetary surface modeling
- Open-source toolkit for planetary robotics research community

## Collaboration Opportunities

I am actively seeking collaboration with:
- Planetary robotics researchers for algorithm validation
- Space agencies for real-world mission scenario testing  
- Academic institutions for joint research publications
- Industry partners for commercial applications
