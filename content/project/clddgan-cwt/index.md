This work focuses on devising a Conditional Latent Denoising Diffusion GAN for generating CWT-based time-frequency images and improving LiteFormer, an attention-free, transformer-inspired classifier for fault classification on augmented datasets.

**This work is in progress currently.**

## Project Overview

This research introduces a novel approach that combines conditional latent denoising diffusion models with Generative Adversarial Networks to generate high-quality Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) based time-frequency representations for industrial fault diagnosis.

## Key Components

• **Conditional Latent Denoising Diffusion GAN**: A hybrid architecture that leverages the stability of diffusion models with the adversarial training of GANs for controlled generation of CWT-based time-frequency images.

• **Enhanced LiteFormer**: An improved version of the attention-free, transformer-inspired classifier designed specifically for fault classification tasks on augmented datasets, providing efficient processing without traditional attention mechanisms.

## Technical Innovation

The project addresses the challenge of limited fault data in industrial systems by generating realistic CWT-based time-frequency representations that capture both temporal and frequency domain characteristics of machinery signals. The conditional nature of the generation process allows for targeted synthesis of specific fault patterns.

## Current Development Status

- Architecture design and implementation
- Initial experiments with CWT generation
- LiteFormer improvements and optimization
- Performance evaluation on industrial datasets

## Expected Contributions

- Novel conditional diffusion-GAN hybrid for time-frequency image generation
- Improved attention-free transformer architecture for fault classification
- Enhanced data augmentation techniques for industrial fault diagnosis
- Comprehensive evaluation on real-world industrial datasets
