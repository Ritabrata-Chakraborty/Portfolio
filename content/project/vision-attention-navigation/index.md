## Overview

Advanced autonomous navigation system that enhances CogniPlan with cross-attention mechanisms and semantic understanding capabilities for improved exploration strategies.

• Enhanced CogniPlan with cross-attention between frontier and node embeddings to enrich node representations

• Incorporated Visual Navigation Transformer (ViNT) to capture semantic context for adaptive exploration strategies

## Technical Stack

**Tech Stack**: ROS Noetic (with Gazebo), PyTorch, Python
