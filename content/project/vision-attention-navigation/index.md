**Project Duration**: August 2025 - Present

Advanced autonomous navigation system that enhances CogniPlan with cross-attention mechanisms and semantic understanding capabilities for improved exploration strategies.

## Key Achievements

• Enhanced CogniPlan with cross-attention between frontier and node embeddings to enrich node representations

• Incorporated Visual Navigation Transformer (ViNT) to capture semantic context for adaptive exploration strategies

## Technical Stack

**Tech Stack**: ROS Noetic (with Gazebo), PyTorch, Python
