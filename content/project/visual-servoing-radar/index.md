**Duration: Jun '24 – Jul '24**

This project develops a sophisticated image-based visual servoing system that combines advanced computer vision algorithms with radar control mechanisms to achieve real-time UAV tracking and automated radar positioning for surveillance applications.

## Project Overview

The research focuses on implementing an automated radar alignment system using state-of-the-art object detection and tracking algorithms to maintain continuous lock on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) through integrated hardware-software control systems.

## Key Achievements

• **YOLOv8 + DeepSORT Integration**: Implemented and optimized the detection-tracking pipeline, achieving 91% tracking recall and 13% improvement in processing speed through model pruning and optimized batching techniques.

• **PLC-based Actuation System**: Designed and integrated a programmable logic controller (PLC) based actuation interface that enables continuous UAV lock-in capabilities with seamless target handover mechanisms.

• **End-to-End Pipeline Development**: Authored comprehensive Python scripts, deployment configurations, and evaluation frameworks for training, inference, and benchmarking the complete visual servoing system.

## Technical Stack

**Computer Vision**: YOLOv8, DeepSORT  
**Programming**: Python  
**Control Systems**: PLC-based actuation  
**Performance**: 91% tracking recall, 13% speed optimization

## Research Impact
