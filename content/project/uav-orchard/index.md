This paper presents a monocular vision-based approach for treeline following, designed to maintain stability under mild wind disturbances. In structured orchards, where trees are arranged in parallel rows, precise automated navigation is essential. Unlike traditional grid-based or path-trail methods, this work utilises instance segmentation to identify and track individual treelines, ensuring accurate differentiation. A curve-fitting algorithm generates a navigation line, with its offset and slope relative to the image centre guiding yaw and roll corrections, while pitch remains constant. The proposed method improves UAV stability and precision in orchard environments, advancing agricultural automation.

This research presents a monocular vision-based UAV navigation system for autonomous treeline following in structured orchards. The approach uses instance segmentation to identify individual treelines and employs curve-fitting algorithms to generate navigation trajectories. The system calculates yaw and roll corrections based on the fitted line's offset and slope relative to the image center, while maintaining constant pitch.
