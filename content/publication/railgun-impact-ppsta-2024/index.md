abstract: "This study investigates the impact resistance of layered composite materials subjected to high-velocity impact, using both experimental and FEM analysis. Materials like SS 304, Al 6061-T6, and GFRP have been strategically layered for optimal energy absorption and protection. Experimental testing with an electromagnetic launcher facility (RAFTAR) at BARC (F), Visakhapatnam, and simulations based on Johnson-Cook models provide insights into deformation and failure mechanisms."

This research presents a comprehensive investigation into the impact resistance of strategically layered metal-composite shields under high-velocity impact conditions. The study combines experimental testing using the electromagnetic launcher facility (RAFTAR) at BARC (F), Visakhapatnam, with advanced finite element method (FEM) simulations to understand deformation and failure mechanisms.

The layered composite design incorporates SS 304 stainless steel, Al 6061-T6 aluminum alloy, and Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) materials, strategically arranged for optimal energy absorption and protection capabilities. Johnson-Cook constitutive models are employed in the numerical simulations to accurately predict material behavior under extreme loading conditions.

This work contributes valuable insights to defense applications and protective structure design, particularly in understanding the synergistic effects of different material layers in mitigating high-velocity impact threats.
