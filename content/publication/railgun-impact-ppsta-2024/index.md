abstract: "This study investigates the impact resistance of layered composite materials subjected to high-velocity impact, using both experimental and FEM analysis. Materials like SS 304, Al 6061-T6, and GFRP have been strategically layered for optimal energy absorption and protection. Experimental testing with an electromagnetic launcher facility (RAFTAR) at BARC (F), Visakhapatnam, and simulations based on Johnson-Cook models provide insights into deformation and failure mechanisms."
