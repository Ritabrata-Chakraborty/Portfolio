abstract: "We present CogniPlan, a novel approach for uncertainty-guided path planning that integrates a Wasserstein GAN-based conditional inpainting model with a graph attention network. Our method achieves 17.7% shorter exploration paths and 3.9% better navigation efficiency across 100+ maps compared to existing approaches."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
